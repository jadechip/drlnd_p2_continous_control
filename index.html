      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>

        Our initial approach to solving the "Reacher" environment involved using multiple agents, and a custom implementation of the D4PG algorithm.
        However this proved challenging, and we were never able to achieve a score higher than 1.5. Due to this as well as time constraints, we instead opted to
        base our implementation on Udacity's DDPG algorithm, used to solve the "Pendulum" environment. We also limted our scope to a single agent.

        We found that the agent was able to complete the task and achieve a score greater than 30 in 267 episodes with a final score of 31.02.

        Please see the plot and table below for more information.
        
      </p>

      <h2>
        Algorithm and Architecture
      </h2>

      The DDPG algorithm uses an two neural networks. The first network is called the Actor, and is used to map states to actions.
      The second network is referred to as the Critic, and maps state-action pairs to Q-values.

      The Actor produces an action given the current state of the environment. The critic then produces  TD error signal, which
      drives learning in both the actor and the critic.

      This approach allows us to optimize a policy, with a continous action-space, in a deterministic fashion.
      
      Target networks for both the Actor and Critic networks are used in order to avoid correlation excessive
      when calculating the loss factor.
      
      </br>
      </br>
      Similarily to the DQN algorithm, DDPG also utilizes a technique known as <strong>Replay Memory</strong>, which involves first storing the experiences, obtained
      from interacting with the environment, and later sampling them randomly and learning from them.
      This further minmizes correlation and stabilizies the performance of the model.

      </br>
      To achieve our results, we used the following hyper parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e6)</li>
        <li>BATCH_SIZE = 128</li>
        <li>GAMMA = 0.99</li>
        <li>TAU = 1e-2</li>
        <li>LR_ACTOR = 1e-4</li>
        <li>LR_CRITIC = 1e-4</li>
        <li>WEIGHT_DECAY = 0</li>
      </ul>

      In our case, the structure of the neural network consists of three linear layers, with an input equal to the state space (37)
      and a final output corresponding to the number of available actions (4). In between, the hidden layer has a total of 64 neurons.
      Finally, we decided to use the relu activation function.

      <h2>Obstacles & Future improvements</h2>
      <p>
        The next step would involve modifying the algorithm with the techniques used in the D4PG algorithm, as well as more experimentation with the model hyper parameters.
